I watched The Big Short more than 10 times. Started programming in QBasic. My favorite biography is Shoe Dog. My favorite football club is FC Barcelona. Never used Vim or Emacs. I don't think Guardiola is overrated and I long for times when Adidas Sala were a thing. Tabs over spaces, IDE over text editor, dark over light theme.

This website is where I share thoughts on what I'm learning, the ideas I care about, and occasionally, reflections on life.
